            <h2>How to Play</h2>
            <p>Chess is a two-player strategy game played on an 8x8 board with alternating light and dark squares. Each player controls 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king, meaning the king is under attack with no legal moves to escape. Players take turns moving one piece at a time, following unique movement rules for each piece. Pawns move forward but capture diagonally, knights move in an L-shape, bishops move diagonally, rooks move horizontally or vertically, and the queen combines both rook and bishop movements. The king moves one square in any direction. Special moves include castling, en passant, and pawn promotion. The game can end in checkmate, stalemate, or a draw under various conditions.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Strategic play in chess involves controlling the center of the board, developing pieces efficiently, and ensuring king safety. A common opening principle is to move pawns to control central squares (e4, d4, e5, d5) and quickly develop knights and bishops. Midgame strategy revolves around positioning, tactical attacks, and exchanges that improve piece activity. Players should look for pins, forks, and skewers to gain material advantages. Endgame play focuses on converting advantages into a checkmate, often by promoting pawns or forcing the opponent’s king into a losing position. Awareness of time control, positional sacrifices, and pattern recognition helps in advanced play.</p>

It challenges players to think critically, plan ahead, and adapt to new situations—all skills that extend beyond the board into everyday life. Chess encourages logical reasoning, patience, and problem-solving, making it a valuable tool for mental development at any age. Studies have even shown that playing chess regularly can improve memory, concentration, and cognitive function, helping players sharpen their minds while enjoying the game. Whether you're looking to develop strategic thinking or simply keep your brain active, chess offers a rewarding mental workout.</p>
