            <ul>
                <li><strong>Design:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Color scheme uses a green background, a grey header, beige text for the nav bar, footer text, and paragraph body content, but white text for the h1 and body headers. I think these colors are good, but should probably be condensed and used more consistently between elements, especially since images being used don't contrast too well.</li>
                        <li>Typography could use some work, as far as I could tell, the website is using the default font family so maybe setting a font to match the website's aestethetic could be beneficial, although using the default font does not do too much harm and easy for readability.</li>
                        <li>Design elements in the header and footer are consistent across the nav, but the main section lacks some consistency in terms of image size and placement. Consistency between text placement is also not really present. This is again, not the worst thing in the world, however it may be something to look at when considering design elements.</li>
                        <li>The header does not take up the width of the page from my desktop view, so you could consider changing the width to match the viewport width.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>HTML & requirements</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The HTML layout is designed in accordance with the guidelines, using a header, main, and footer section inside the body. The nav bar is present in the header and accumulus is added for validation.</li>
                        <li>All the project specific requirements seem to be met, I would just note that the about section should probably include a mission statement and a unique image to differ from the home section.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Conclusion</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The website has a good and clear HTML structure, the main thing I would suggest is cleaning up the header, using different images for different pages and fixing the placement of images to look more clean/consistent, especially on the contact page that has an offfset maps picture along with the golf picture (You could maybe replace the golf picture with the google maps and add some more content to the left?) As well as some other suggestions listed above. Overall, I think you did good to meet the project requirements.</li>
