            <ul>
                <li><strong>Design:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Color scheme is pleasing, beige and green for easy contrast with pictures and white form/section elements</li>
                        <li>Typography for the body elements is good and matches the page, but the h1 of "Stephan Salazar Photography" could be a bit hard to read given the heavy cursive font</li>
                        <li>Design elements are consistent for the most part, but could maybe make the submit and next buttons have the same look since they have the same color and feel without the same border radius. However, the buttons on the services page look very good with the drop shadow and hover style</li>
                        <li>Hovering over a picture enlarges it by a lot, I would recommend just slightly changing how large they get when hovered over to take up a little less of the page and adding the same hover style to the images on the home page for consistency, but overall i love the styles and hover elements that make the site feel dynamic.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>HTML & requirements</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The HTML layout is designed in accordance with the guidelines, using a header, main, and footer section inside the body. The nav bar is present in the header and accumulus is added for validation.</li>
                        <li>All the project specific requirements seem to be met.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Conclusion</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Interacting with the site feels very clean and dynamic and the color scheme is perfect for the website. However, I think some changes for consistency mentioned above could be useful as suggestions to take into consideration. I would also note that the home page feels very similar to the portfolio page and maybe adding a mission statement or about me text to the home page could help distinguish the two.</li>
